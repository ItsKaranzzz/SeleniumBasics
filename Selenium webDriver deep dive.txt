Representational state transfer

Selenium client Library(Ruby, C#, Java, etc)  (having REST based APIs: using GET and POST calls from seperate methods [i.e.,.refresh(), .forward(), .back(), etc])
JSON file(key and value pair)  {JASON wire protocol over HTTP)
server/driver(opera,chrome,IE,etc)
HTTP over HTTP server
Real Browser
 

When the automation script is executed, the following steps happen:

+for each Selenium command, a HTTP request is created and sent to the browser driver
+the browser driver uses a HTTP server(provided by browsers) for getting the HTTP requests
the HTTP server determines the steps needed for implementing the Selenium command
+the implementation steps are executed on the browser
+the execution status is sent back to the HTTP server
+the HTTP server sends the status back to the automation script

Selenium Client Library ---> JSON wire protocol over HTTP ---> Browser driver(create the request and send or receieve through) --->HTTP server ---> Actual Browser
