DOM(Document Object Model)

types:

HTLML DOM
XML DOM
core DOM

HTML DOM is actually an API provided by browser


Structure:

Document

Root

head, body

title , href, a , h1

text, div

when we do the inspect we get the complete HTML DOM (that is not actually HTML code)

DOM-w3c (world wide web consortium) standard

DOm is a kind of platform/interface which is available in the form of API, provided by different types of browsers(chrome, IE, safari)

according to browser/ browser versions we have different DOM structures
ex:
facebook.com should be compatible with all the browser for which UI developer write their code which is compatible with all the browser


html DOM

webservices

DB

facebook developer will write JavaScript for each DOM provided by broowsers

CRUD(Create, read/get, Delete, Change, U-update/change, ) APIs
 Javascript can change the elements appearing in the UI

DOM will be different for each page of site and DOM will get created during run time

JavaScript can perform actions on the DOM and through DOM API site actions get performed

so DOM API(CRUD operations) provided by browser helps UI dev to use javaSCript to create any element

hence in selenium also we are using javascript performed on DOM aPI

create, Read, update, Delete (API) s provided by seperate browser

selenium interacts with HTML DOM



properties in HTML DOM:

a. change the properties
b. access different methods
c. create events as well

each time a page is loaded browser creates a DOM of the page
