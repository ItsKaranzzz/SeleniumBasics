API and Webservices



API: Application Programming Interface

Ex: calcultor jar file becomes an API to test

API/backend testing: will be done on API jar level for validating the functionalities of different methods.

Ex: Selenium jar file

If we need to test it we need to do API testing also known as Backend testing where we do not have any UI

Lets suppose if we have different system where we are communicating with each other using different format files like: JSON format or HTML format/xml format

here system wont show their business logic they just provide their APIs(name, URL, format, authentication) so sometimes here Unique key/auth key is provided
to share the API between them the company sharing the API will set the format of transfer, these are formats to communicate between each other since there are light weight


API is always used when two system are interacting with each other and they both are totally independent to each other.

WebServices:
When multiple systems deal with each other and communicating over HTTP calls over the nw(these are APIs only like the one I have used in GRASP, PPV) such type of
API are web services here there are no JAR files sharing etc for APIs only the nw and auth ID is required.

API webservices require:

-Auth ID/token ID
-type of req(JSON/XML)
-method type (HTTP) in the form of CRUD operations (i.e, GET or POST)


-SOAP is obselete these days
-REST people are working on coz it is light weight

API / webservices (major difference is using API jar or using HTTP network for the communication)

API pure methods but we dont have access to code base (jar files)
some jar files are open source(API) (ex: Selenium, LINUX) 

types of webservices:

SOAP vs REST

Simple Object Access Protocol:
-It is a protocol
-SOAP cant use REST since it is a protocol
-SOAP uses service Interface
-JacsWS security system provided for SOAP base services
-It permit only xml format
-heavy technology and obselete now

Representational State 
-It is not a protocol
-REst can use SOAP as well
-REST uses URI/URL
-JacsRS provided for REST base services
-Fast and light weight
-Require more bandwidth
-It premit any format : xml, json,etc
